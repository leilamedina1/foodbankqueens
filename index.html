				Brigada de la Esperanza, an organization in Queens, New York, emerged in response to COVID-19 and has evolved into an organization committed to helping migrants affected by the recent wave of migration. Founded by Nancy Titua√±a, it has approximately 150 volunteers, mostly from Latin America, who meet weekly to sort and distribute donations of food, clothing, and essential goods. The group delivers between 350 and 500 food baskets each week to people from diverse backgrounds.

				The project is targeting food insecurity issues in Queens, where according to the New York City Mayor's Office Food Metrics Report, 12.1% of people are food insecure. According to them they help over 350 to 400 families weekly.
